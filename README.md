## How it works
 
First, you need to configure WeChat API and provide its credentials in the extension’s configurations using our step-by-step guide. Once configured, enable the Login with WeChat button to be displayed on all login and registration forms
 
Once logging in with WeChat, your website visitors only need to provide the login and password of their existing WeChat account to log in or create an account on your store. 
 
Additionally, this simple login feature offers much more than just a login option:
* The plugin automatically retrieves user profile data from their WeChat accounts and enriches your customer database with valuable information such as email, gender, birth date, location, and more. 
* Give your customers a personal touch. Automatically display a user profile photo retrieved from their WeChat account next to the User Account menu or anywhere else on your Magento site.
* Let users share your products with friends on social media and gain additional exposure that may not be possible on your own site. It's like creating an Internet buzz around your brand without spending thousands of dollars on advertising alone. 
* Increase your sales by implementing the Login with WeChat at checkout! This will save customers time and let them make purchases quickly and hassle-free.
 
This simplified sign-up and sign-in process maximizes the security and prevents anyone from creating multiple accounts. **Start making thousands of sales today with this simple yet powerful feature!**
